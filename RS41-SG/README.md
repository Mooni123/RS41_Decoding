# RS41-SG
The RS41-SG is for the most part sending exactly the same data as the RS41-SGP, so please take a look there for the main part. Only the differences are discussed here.

## Differences to RS41-SGP

There is only one major difference: the three measurement values for the pressure in the 7A-MEAS block are all empty and filled with 0s.

## Subframe

The subframe of the RS41-SG may contain some hints on which bytes in the -SGP have something to do with the pressure calculation. However, I haven't come around to take a look at it yet.
