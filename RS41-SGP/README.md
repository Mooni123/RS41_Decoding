# RS41-SGP
The RS41-SGP is the sonde mos often used in germany, and as it's frame has very much the same structure as the one of the -SG, the main examination shall be conducted only here.

A Frame of a RS41-SGP looks like the following

![rs41-sgp_frame](__used_asset__/pic_rs41-sgp_frame.png?raw=true "rs41-sgp_frame")

There are six different blocks inside this frame:
1. [79-STATUS](#79-STATUS)
2. [7A-MEAS](#7A-MEAS)
3. [7C-GPSINFO](#7C-GPSINFO)
4. [7D-GPSRAW](#7D-GPSRAW)
5. [7B-GPSPOS](#7B-GPSPOS)
6. [76-EMPTY](#76-EMPTY)

# \#79-STATUS
test

```
The whole XOR-mask is as follows:
0x96, 0x83, 0x3E, 0x51, 0xB1, 0x49, 0x08, 0x98,
0x32, 0x05, 0x59, 0x0E, 0xF9, 0x44, 0xC6, 0x26,
0x21, 0x60, 0xC2, 0xEA, 0x79, 0x5D, 0x6D, 0xA1,
0x54, 0x69, 0x47, 0x0C, 0xDC, 0xE8, 0x5C, 0xF1,
0xF7, 0x76, 0x82, 0x7F, 0x07, 0x99, 0xA2, 0x2C,
0x93, 0x7C, 0x30, 0x63, 0xF5, 0x10, 0x2E, 0x61,
0xD0, 0xBC, 0xB4, 0xB6, 0x06, 0xAA, 0xF4, 0x23,
0x78, 0x6E, 0x3B, 0xAE, 0xBF, 0x7B, 0x4C, 0xC1
